# Native Javascript for Bootstrap
This repository is a fork of the awesome [bootstrap.native](https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native).

I created it to solve this issue: https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/issues/62

I could not implement all widgets. Here you can find:
- Alert
- Button
- Carousel (may require initialization if it needs to start moving automatically. Initializing multiple times has no side effect).
- Collapse
- Dropdown
- Modal
- Progress bar (not available trough JavaScript in bootstrap.native or Twitter Bootstrap)
- Tab

bootstrap.native.dynamic is shared in case you want to use it, but also do consider reading [this](https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/issues/102).
